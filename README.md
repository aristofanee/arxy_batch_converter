# Arxy Batch Converter

The Arxy Batch Converter is a Python script that efficiently converts .aryx files to CSV format in bulk. The program maintains the original file names and preserves the directory structure while converting the files.

## Requirements
- For .exe release you shouldn't need any requirement.
- For running the script, look at what Python libraries you dont have already installed.

## Usage
1. Select the source directory where you have all the .aryx file that you want to convert.
2. Select where you want to export the folder with the .csv files (you can't export inside the source folder)
3. Done. The script will automatically clone the whole folder structure to the new path and convert every .aryx file it encouters in .csv while keeping the original name.
